# Graphite Grafana Demo

## Purpose

The purpose of this application is to show a demo of graphite grafana integration with the metrics that are emiited from a spring boot application

## What's inside

The repo is a working application with a minimal setup. It contains:
 * application skeleton
 * setup script to prepare project
 * common plugins and libraries
 * docker setup
 * swagger configuration for api documentation ([see how to publish your api documentation to shared repository](https://github.com/hmcts/reform-api-docs#publish-swagger-docs))
 * MIT license and contribution information

The application exposes health endpoint (http://localhost:4550/health) and metrics endpoint
(http://localhost:4550/metrics).

## Plugins

The template contains the following plugins:


  * Graphite

     Graphite is an enterprise-ready monitoring tool that runs equally well on cheap hardware or Cloud infrastructure. 
     Teams use Graphite to track the performance of the websites, applications, business services, and networked servers. 
     It marked the start of a new generation of monitoring tools, making it easier than ever to store, retrieve,  share, and visualize time-series data.

  * Grafana

     Grafana is a multi-platform open source analytics and interactive visualization web application. 
     It provides charts, graphs, and alerts for the web when connected to supported data sources. 
     A licensed Grafana Enterprise version with additional capabilities is also available as a self-hosted installation or an account on the Grafana Labs cloud service. 
     It is expandable through a plug-in system. End users can create complex monitoring dashboards using interactive query builders. 
     Grafana is divided into a front end and back end, written in TypeScript and Go, respectively.

  * checkstyle

    https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/checkstyle_plugin.html

    Performs code style checks on Java source files using Checkstyle and generates reports from these checks.
    The checks are included in gradle's *check* task (you can run them by executing `./gradlew check` command).

  * pmd

    https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/pmd_plugin.html

    Performs static code analysis to finds common programming flaws. Included in gradle `check` task.


  * jacoco

    https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/jacoco_plugin.html

    Provides code coverage metrics for Java code via integration with JaCoCo.
    You can create the report by running the following command:

    ```bash
      ./gradlew jacocoTestReport
    ```

    The report will be created in build/reports subdirectory in your project directory.

  * io.spring.dependency-management

    https://github.com/spring-gradle-plugins/dependency-management-plugin

    Provides Maven-like dependency management. Allows you to declare dependency management
    using `dependency 'groupId:artifactId:version'`
    or `dependency group:'group', name:'name', version:version'`.

  * org.springframework.boot

    http://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/

    Reduces the amount of work needed to create a Spring application

  * org.owasp.dependencycheck

    https://jeremylong.github.io/DependencyCheck/dependency-check-gradle/index.html

    Provides monitoring of the project's dependent libraries and creating a report
    of known vulnerable components that are included in the build. To run it
    execute `gradle dependencyCheck` command.

  * com.github.ben-manes.versions

    https://github.com/ben-manes/gradle-versions-plugin

    Provides a task to determine which dependencies have updates. Usage:

    ```bash
      ./gradlew dependencyUpdates -Drevision=release
    ```

## Setup

Located in `./bin/init.sh`. Simply run and follow the explanation how to execute it.

## Notes

Since Spring Boot 2.1 bean overriding is disabled. If you want to enable it you will need to set `spring.main.allow-bean-definition-overriding` to `true`.

JUnit 5 is now enabled by default in the project. Please refrain from using JUnit4 and use the next generation

## Building and deploying the application

### Building the application

The project uses [Gradle](https://gradle.org) as a build tool. It already contains
`./gradlew` wrapper script, so there's no need to install gradle.

To build the project execute the following command:

```bash
  ./gradlew build
```

### Running the application

Create the image of the application by executing the following command:

```bash
  ./gradlew assemble
```

Create docker image:

```bash
  docker-compose build
```

Run the distribution (created in `build/install/spring-boot-template` directory)
by executing the following command:

```bash
  docker-compose up
```

This will start the API container exposing the application's port
(set to `4550` in this template app).

In order to test if the application is up, you can call its health endpoint:

```bash
  curl http://localhost:4550/health
```

You should get a response similar to this:

```
  {"status":"UP","diskSpace":{"status":"UP","total":249644974080,"free":137188298752,"threshold":10485760}}
```

### Alternative script to run application

To skip all the setting up and building, just execute the following command:

```bash
./bin/run-in-docker.sh
```

For more information:

```bash
./bin/run-in-docker.sh -h
```

Script includes bare minimum environment variables necessary to start api instance. Whenever any variable is changed or any other script regarding docker image/container build, the suggested way to ensure all is cleaned up properly is by this command:

```bash
docker-compose rm
```

It clears stopped containers correctly. Might consider removing clutter of images too, especially the ones fiddled with:

```bash
docker images

docker image rm <image-id>
```
